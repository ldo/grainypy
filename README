**GrainyPy** is a set of functions for Python 3.4 or later that take
high-quality images and make them look like rubbish. There are
functions for applying various dithering algorithms, which reduce the
bit depth of an image while trying to maintain an approximation of the
original colours, and some other pixel-munging stuff.

The low-level functionality is implemented in **grainyx**, which is
written in C. The **grainy** higher-level wrapper provides an
interface with the Cairo 2D graphics library, as well as other
functionality that makes the operations easier to use.

Installation is explained in the setup.py script. This module also
requires [Qahirah](https://github.com/ldo/qahirah), my Cairo graphics
wrapper, to be installed.

Example code showing GrainyPy in action is available from
the [grainypy_examples](https://github.com/ldo/grainypy_examples) repo.
